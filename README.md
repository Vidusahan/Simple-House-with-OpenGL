# 🏠 3D House Design using OpenGL

This project demonstrates a simple 3D house modeled using OpenGL with GLAD and GLFW in C++. 
The house is constructed using basic geometric primitives (cubes, pyramids) to visualize 
architectural features such as walls, roof, doors, and windows.

## 🚀 Features

- 3D rendering using modern OpenGL
- Wireframe and solid models
- Interactive camera (rotate and zoom)
- House with doors and windows

## 🧱 Built With

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - for windowing and input
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) - for OpenGL function loading
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - for rendering
